Empowering Girls & Women to Excel in STEAM Since 1992

Choose a cause and execute a high-fidelity clickable prototype (Figma/Adobe XD/InVision) and code 1-3 responsive web pages through FE development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). You can redesign an existing causeâ€™s site or app, or create something new. 

WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY (WIT) EMPOWERS GIRLS AND WOMEN TO EXCEL IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, THE ARTS, AND MATH (STEAM) FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE BOARDROOM.
We do this by providing our community with education, exposure, and experience.  By sharing the stories of successful professionals across the STEAM fields, we encourage all generations of girls and women to write their future.
